            travel Tips
            
            - The best time to visit Trang is between December and May. High and low seasons aren't clearly defined; some resorts are closed into the early high season (mid-November), while others start charging high season rates as early as October.
            
            - Before visiting Tham Le Khao Kop, make sure that you are not a claustrophobic since you have to travel through a very narrow passage through the cave tunnel before you reach an end to the exit.
            
            - Do not touch the water drop on the tip of a growing stalactite because the grease on our fingers will interrupt the growth of stalactite.
            
            - Even though boat operators already have torches provided, it is recommended to have your own waterproof head torch when you make a trip into a cave.
            
            - Bring along a waterproof bag or pocket every time when you go on a beach trip. It is useful for protecting your valuable belongings during your kayak Boat trip. 
            
            - Do not forget to bring a high SPF sunscreen, a hat and a pair of sunglasses.
